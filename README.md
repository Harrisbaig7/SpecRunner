# Intro To JavaScript

## Required Software

This module is an introduction to JavaScript.  You will need to have node and bower installed in order to follow this course.  

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Download the package for your operating system.  You can use chocolatey, brew, or another package manager instead.

Once it's installed, open a new terminal or command prompt.  Type

    npm install -g express bower
     
This will install express and bower into your global dependencies. 

Next, change directory in the terminal to where you downloaded the files.  Then type in the terminal `npm install`.  This will install the local dependenices for the project.  Then type `bower install`, this will install the bower dependencies.

Finally, type in `npm start`.  This will launch the server on port 5000.  Type in `localhost:5000` and you can view the project.

## Recommended Software

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)  Chrome uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine NodeJS uses.  It features advanced debugging tools and will be what I use in the course.
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) Webstorm is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment.  The advantage is that it's more friendly for new programmers and more feature-filled without any configuration, but it costs money.  Free for 30 days or with a student license.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) Atom is built in Electron, a JavaScript Environment for the desktop.  It's completely free.
